    "## Class 2 – Going Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous class we learned all the basic ingredients of programming (numbers, strings, lists, etc.), as well as the fundamental \"control structures\" (`if`, `for`, and `while`). This small handful of components will allow you to do practically anything – the only limits are your time and imagination! However, there are still some more programming structures that are worth learning. Although these new structures are less fundamental, they will help you to organize your code into discrete, modular chunks that are easier to understand and conceptualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key concept in programming is abstraction. This is the idea that we can wrap up a bunch of technical details in a single machine, and then we can forget about all the internal technical details – we just need a high-level understanding of what the machine does. In Python, there are four main levels of abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions: Lines of code can be organized into functions that carry out particular procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classes: A bunch of related functions can be organized together in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modules: A bunch of functions and classes can be organized together in a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Packages: A bunch of modules can be organized together in a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move up the hierarchy, towards the more abstract levels, we can forget about the nitty-gritty details at the lower levels and focus on more general concepts. Likewise, as we move down the hierarchy we can zoom in to more technical details. For example, the [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org) package, which is used for running behavioral experiments, is comprised of several modules, including one module to deal with timing, another to deal with hardware, and another to deal with sound. Within each module, there are several classes; for example, within the hardware module, you might have classes for dealing with the mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Finally, within classes, there will be multiple functions (technically, they're called \"methods\"), which define particular procedures; for example, within the mouse class, there will be methods to access where the mouse is currently positioned or which button is currently being pressed.\n",

    "You've already used several functions, perhaps without even realizing. In the last notebook, you used the `print()` function in order to put stuff on the screen, you used the `len()` function to find out how many items are in a list, and you used the `range()` function to generate a list of counting numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all **\"built-in\" functions** – that is, functions that are a core part of Python. Unlike other languages, Python has a very minimal set of built-in functions; however, there are many useful functions which can be **imported** if you need to use them. More importantly, you can define your own functions. This turns out to be extremely useful for organizing your code and minimizing unnecessary code duplication. It also makes it easier to test and understand your code because you can isolate each part of the machine and understand it independently of everything else. When you become a proficient programmer, 99% of your code will be organized into functions: You define all the functions you need and then you \"conduct\" them as if you were conducting an orchestra.\n",

If you had a list with a billion numbers and tried to reverse it, the computer would have to waste a lot of memory representing two versions of the list: the original list and the reversed version. By creating an iterator object, Python doesn't actually need to create a new list in memory; the iterator object just represents the *concept* of looking at the original list in reverse order. When you iterate over the iterator object, Python just reads the original list in reverse.\n",

If you write something like `range(1, 1000000000001)` (the range of numbers from one to one trillion), the numbers are not actually created in memory. In fact, I'm not sure it's even possible to represent this many numbers in memory simultaneously. If each number requires 64 bits to represent, then you would need 64 trillion bits, which is equivalent to seven thousand gigabytes. To put that in context, my computer has 32 gigabytes of RAM.

Like variables, you can choose whatever name you want, but it's good to choose something descriptive. The name of the function is followed by a set of parentheses which contain the function's **arguments**, or in other words, variable names that will be used to represent the function's inputs. In this case, the function has a single argument `numbers` (note that, although the user will pass in multiple numbers, they only actually pass in one object, a list; thus, the function only takes one input – it has one argument). As you would expect, you are free to choose the argument names. Here I chose the argument name `numbers` because it communicates to the user what I expect them to pass in – a list of numbers. Finally, like `if`, `for`, and `while`, the first line of the function definition ends with a colon (`:`).\n",

I won't explain the internal workings here – instead, I leave it to you to study the code and understand how it works. However, the important thing is that the function definition ends with a `return` statement. The `return` statement specifies the output of the function – the object that will be returned when the function completes. In this case, our `product()` function needs to return... the product, which I represented by the variable `total`.\n",
