    "The goal of this first class is to get everyone familar with the core building blocks of programming: numbers, strings, operators, conditional statements, and looping structures. You may have learned some of these concepts before; even so, try to work through the notebook step-by-step – there's probably at least a few things that you didn't already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this first class, you should be able to code some simple algorithms! However, you will also need to learn some meta-skills along the way. For example, it may take you some time to get Python set up correctly on your computer, and you will need to get familiar with Jupyter notebooks. It's also worth learning some of the keyboard shortcuts to make life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running some code, **you should always try to predict the outcome first**. In other words, don't just run the code and look at the result; instead, read the code, try to predict what will happen, and *then* run the code. This will give you a much better sense of what stuff you understand and what stuff you don't understand. You should also try changing the code to see what happens when you run it again. Does it do what you expected?\n",

    "If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to get my attention and I'll come help. But also: Talk to the people around you because they are probably having the same problems!\n",

    "If you don't manage to finish this notebook by the end of the class, don't worry, that's okay, there are a lot of new concepts to learn and not very much time. However, do try to continue working through the material at home."

    "So far, we've only used one particular data type, the **integer** (``int``). Integers are whole numbers, like ``1``, ``117``, or ``-99``. However, there are many other data types and it is important to understand how they work and when they should be used. In Python, the most important data types are **strings** (``str``), **floating points** (``float``), **Booleans** (``bool``), **lists** (``list``), and **dictionaries** (``dict``). In other languages, these data types sometimes have different names. For example, lists are sometimes called \"arrays\" or \"vectors\" and dictionaries are sometimes called \"objects\" or \"named arrays\".\n",

    "Floating point numbers (floats) are a special type of number that can have decimal expansions. For example, `100.5`, `3.14159`, or `-0.0001`. In some programming languages, it is important to choose the right type of number (i.e. integers or floats) depending on what you want to do. In Python, it often doesn't matter – the choice between integers (e.g. `1`) and floats (e.g. `1.0`) is usually just an implementation detail that you don't need to worry about. For example, if I calculate `1` (an integer) divided by `3` (an integer), the result is automatically **cast as** (converted to) a float:"

An `elif` statement is only evaluated if the previous `if`s and `elif`s were `False`. The code inside the `else` statement is only executed if all the `if`s and `elif`s were `False`.
