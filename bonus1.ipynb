    "Python is often described as an object-oriented language. In fact, Python is a multi-paradigm language – it supports the procedural, functional, and object-oriented styles of programming. Nevertheless, Python certainly leans more towards the object-oriented style, and indeed much of the language is actually implemented in the form of objects, so it is quite useful to have a basic understanding of OOP, even if you don't really intend to use the language that way. If you'd like to understand how OOP compares to the other major programming paradigms, check out this video on YouTube: [Four Programming Paradigms In 40 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgVVZMfLjEI).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The `class` keyword is used to define a class. It is followed by the name of the class and a colon (`:`). Like variables and functions, you can give your class any name you want, but, by convention, we usually capitalize the first letter of class names – `Person`, not `person` – to make them more distinctive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Indented within the class there are three functions. In fact, we call these **methods**. Methods are basically the same as regular functions, except they are defined within a class. Just like functions, methods can also have return statements and take optional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `__init__()` method is a special method that is used to **initialize** (create) an instance of the class. Special methods begin and end with a double underscore (`__`), which is pronounced \"dunder\". We will see more of these special methods soon. Most classes will at least have an `__init__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The initializer method creates and store two **attributes**, the person's name and age. An attribute is basically just a variable, but it's a variable within a class. We will explore how this works soon (this relates to the mysterious word `self` that pops up in several places in the code).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. And finally, the class has two other regular methods, `say_name()` and `say_age()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, up until now we have been working with variables and functions, but in the context of classes, variables and functions are referred to as attributes and methods. But these are basically the same thing – so don't let the new vocabulary confuse you. A lot of the details are the same, we're just moving up to a new level of abstraction.\n",

Typically, the initializer might do various types of validation or initiation of the object, but in our very simple case, the `__init__()` method just stores the passed-in name and age as attributes. If this is a bit unclear, don't worry... hopefully it should start to become more clear as we actually do stuff with the objects.\n",

You also need to remember to add `self` as the first argument to every method (even special methods). The `self` stuff is a little confusing to be honest, but the syntax works like this because of the particular way objects are implemented in Python. Basically, you just have to memorize the syntax and accept it! (If you're curious, technically, when you call an object's method, the object itself is passed into that method as an invisible first argument, which allows the method to access the object's own unique attributes.

In the case of our `FortuneTeller`, we don't really need to create lots of different instances; instead, the main reason for using a class was just to organize a bunch of related code together.
